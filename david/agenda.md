## Highlight

What's not in the CV

From my recent appraisal
> You have shown to be one of the most resilient, organized, methodical and consistent performers on the team. The fact that you’ve managed to get tasks and projetcs through with very positive outcomes in a context of changing priorities, and very dispersed asks, is something that sets you apart within my team. I have much appreciated having you as a very reliable team member, so which I could throw any kind of problem, knowing it would be taken care of.
